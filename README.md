# Rocks Catalog
This web page was developed for the Quantum Robotics team.

Its purpose is to store data on different rocks that their robot might encounter on other planets.

## Usage

The main request the Quantum Robotics team had was to include a navigation that could filter the data being displayed based on the user's inputs. It was my first time working with something like this and I think it turned out to be really good.

Its original purpose was to connect to a local database. This database was designed in MySQL. Nevertheless, I later learned that you need to use PHP to connect the database with the HTML. I plan to learn PHP soon, but until then, the data will be stored directly in the program.

## Features

- Navigation with a filter
- Responsive designâ€”use it on any device.
- User-friendly
